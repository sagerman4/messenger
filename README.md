# messenger
A little Angular.js application which lets you create messages, store them, and view them.  They are only stored for the current JVM session, though.  No real persisitence.


I've got it set to run in glassfish or weblogic using the 'messenger' context root, but it should work on any Java application server.

This thing uses Spring and Jersey, by the way, though it doesn't realy need Spring.  Just there for injection purposes.
